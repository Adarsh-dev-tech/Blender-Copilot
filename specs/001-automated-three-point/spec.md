# Feature Specification: Automated Three-Point Lighting Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-automated-three-point`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Automated Three-Point Lighting Setup - The user needs a fast, one-command way to set up a standard three-point lighting rig that is automatically aimed at their selected object. This saves them from the repetitive manual process of creating, placing, and configuring three individual lights."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A 3D artist working in Blender has selected an object (character, product, sculpture) that they want to light professionally. Instead of manually creating three separate lights, positioning them, aiming them, and configuring their properties - a process that takes several minutes and requires knowledge of lighting principles - they can issue a natural language command like "create a three-point light setup" or "light the selected object". The system instantly creates a complete, professionally configured lighting rig that automatically focuses on their object, allowing them to immediately see their work properly lit and continue with their creative process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected a mesh object in Blender, **When** they issue the command "create a three-point light setup", **Then** the system creates three area lights (Key, Fill, Rim) positioned in standard three-point configuration, all aimed at the selected object via Track To constraints, organized in a "Lighting Rig" collection
2. **Given** a user has selected a character mesh, **When** they type "light the selected object", **Then** the system creates the lighting rig with appropriate default power values (Key light brightest, Fill softer, Rim accent) and the character is immediately well-lit
3. **Given** a user has multiple objects selected, **When** they request three-point lighting, **Then** the system uses the active object as the target for the lighting rig
4. **Given** a user has no objects selected, **When** they request three-point lighting, **Then** the system displays a clear error message asking them to select an object first

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the selected object is very large or very small?
- How does the system handle objects that are not at the origin?
- What if there are existing lights with the same names in the scene?
- How does the system behave if the active object is not a mesh (e.g., camera, light, empty)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language commands like "create a three-point light setup" or "light the selected object"
- **FR-002**: System MUST create exactly three Area Light objects named "Key Light", "Fill Light", and "Rim Light"
- **FR-003**: System MUST position lights in standard three-point configuration relative to the selected object (Key at 45¬∞ left, Fill at 45¬∞ right, Rim at 135¬∞ behind)
- **FR-004**: System MUST create an Empty object at the center of the selected object to serve as the lighting target
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply Track To constraints to all three lights targeting the Empty object
- **FR-006**: System MUST set default power values with Key light being brightest, Fill light being softer, and Rim light providing accent
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize all created objects (lights and target Empty) under a new collection named "Lighting Rig"
- **FR-008**: System MUST use the active object as the target when multiple objects are selected
- **FR-009**: System MUST display an error message when no object is selected
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically calculate appropriate light distances based on the object's bounding box dimensions
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure light names are unique by appending numbers if conflicts exist (e.g., "Key Light.001")

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lighting Rig**: A complete three-point lighting setup consisting of three lights, one target empty, and organizational collection
- **Target Object**: The selected mesh object that the lighting rig will be aimed at and positioned around
- **Light Configuration**: Default power, color, and positioning values for each of the three light types
- **Spatial Relationship**: The geometric positioning of lights relative to the target object based on three-point lighting principles
